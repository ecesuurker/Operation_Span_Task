In this experiment, you will be presented with a series of images or words that you will need to remember.
There will be 5 different trials that consist of 12 blocks, after each trial you will be given the chance
to take a break. Each block will consist of 2 to 5 images or words, and after each block you will be asked
to write the names of the words or images that you were presented with in that trial. Each image and word 
will be succeeded by a simple mathematics question that will be presented for 3 seconds. After that point
the math question will disappear and you will be asked to indicate whether the math question is correct or
not. If it is correct, please press "a", if it is wrong please press "l". "True" and "False" labels will 
be presented on the side of the associated key, so if you forget you can just press to the button that is
on the side of the label. 

Good Luck!
